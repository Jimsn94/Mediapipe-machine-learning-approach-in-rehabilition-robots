#The purspose of using mediapipe in this project is determining the angle of knee for several purposes.
#The purpose of writing this code was to implement it in an elderly care robot that provides mechanical support to personnel with difficulty in sit-to-stand motion to train it for better and more accurate performance.
Another application can be in advanced physiotherapy and Exergames to assess the patient's rehabilitation progress.
#To run this code you need to install numpy, mediapipe and opencv
